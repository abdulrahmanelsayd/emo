High-end 3D landing page featuring:
1. **Monjori Fluid Shader** (Hero)
2. **Kinect Depth Cloud** (Features)

## 🚨 Required Assets

The Kinect effect requires a specific video texture to work correctly.
1. Place your depth map video file at: `public/textures/kinect.webm`
2. If you don't have one, the app will still run but the middle section might be empty or black.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

npm run build
```

The app uses **React Three Fiber** and **Post-Processing** for premium visuals.
